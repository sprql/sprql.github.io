I like fish - shell that works straight out of the box.
But I really miss the feature which the zsh and the bash have. It's reverse history search (ctrl+r).

But there is a solution — [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) — general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder.

Fzf works not only with shells but with some editors, for example - vim.
