If you want to use the same IP for few sites, you need [SNI][sni] support by target browsers (some legacy browser have not it).

For HTTP2 modern browser use [ALPN][alpn] instead NPN, so check what you have installed OpenSSL with version 1.0.2+ to have ALPN!

I assume you have certificates, for example, I write how to obtain it in [previous post][letsencrypt-post].

Yes you can think this is yet another SSL configuration for nginx, so this is my result after longspun research:


```
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;
    ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/chain.pem;

    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
    ssl_session_timeout 10m;
    ssl_session_tickets off;

    ssl_stapling on;
    ssl_stapling_verify on;

    resolver 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4;

    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    ssl_ciphers 'ECDHE:+AES256:-3DES:RSA+AES:!NULL:!RC4';

    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=15768000";
    ...
}
```


Some notes about this configuration:

- you should set `ssl_trusted_certificate` to enable `ssl_stapling`
- as `resolver` you can use your local DNS like [dnsmasq][dnsmasq]
- `ssl_session_tickets` should be `off` for all server configurations otherwise you can get [strage error in some browser][ssl_session_tickets], so it's better to set it in `http {}`
- `Strict-Transport-Security` header should have age more than six months, which one add `+` to your grade
- for `ssl_ciphers` I use ECDHE ciphers instead DHE, so no need to set `ssl_dhparam` and generate dhparam.pem with 2048 bits


As result I get 'A+' by [SSL Server Test from SSL Labs][ssltest].

P.S. You can check [configuration generator for different web servers][mozilla-ssl-config-generator] with recommendations from Mozilla.
